# MusicPlayer


1. PLAY, PAUSE, NEXT, PREV, SEEKBAR, READING SONGS FROM PHONE STORAGE 
   
   Add latest Dexter 
   implementation 'com.karumi:dexter:6.2.1'
   
   In Manifest get the ReadExternalStorage Permission
   
   2. I have added an optional on Completion Listener (if the song finishes it jumps to the next one automatically) if you want to use this you have to remove the */ tag from that method. its in @PlayerActivity.java file
